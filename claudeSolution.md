# Claude Code Crash Prevention Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan to prevent Claude Code crashes during complex agent sessions. The plan addresses external tool blocking, agent command safety, delegation loop detection, and systematic timeout protection.

## Phase 1: Agent Activity Logging System

### Implementation Strategy
Create a shared logging system that tracks all agent delegations and external command executions to provide visibility into crash patterns.

### Components

#### 1.1 Agent Activity Log File
- **Location**: `D:\agent-activity.log`
- **Format**: `[timestamp] EVENT: agent-name, depth=X, action=Y, details=Z`
- **Rotation**: Keep last 1000 lines to prevent file growth

#### 1.2 Logging Standards for All Agents
```markdown
# Agent Entry Point Logging
[2025-08-20T10:30:45] START: agent-name, depth=2, parent=primary-claude, task=description

# Delegation Logging  
[2025-08-20T10:30:50] DELEGATE: agent-name -> subagent-name, depth=3, reason=blocking-error

# External Command Logging
[2025-08-20T10:30:55] COMMAND: agent-name, cmd=npm install, timeout=60s, start

# Completion Logging
[2025-08-20T10:31:15] END: agent-name, duration=30s, status=success, delegations=2
```

#### 1.3 Log Analysis Utilities
- **Circuit Breaker Detection**: Script to identify delegation loops from log patterns
- **Command Duration Analysis**: Track which external commands are slow/hanging
- **Crash Investigation**: Post-crash log analysis for pattern identification

## Phase 2: Systematic Agent Command Auditing

### Implementation Strategy
Comprehensively review all agents to identify potentially blocking external tool usage and add defensive programming.

### Components

#### 2.1 Agent Command Inventory
Scan all agent files for:
- `Bash(` calls without timeout parameters
- External tools: `cspell`, `npm`, `npx`, `git`, `gh`, `markdownlint`
- Long-running operations: package installs, repository operations, spell checking

#### 2.2 Blocking Command Categories
**High Risk (>30s timeout needed)**:
- `npm install`, `npm update`
- `git clone`, `git pull` (large repos)
- `cspell` operations on large files
- `gh` API operations

**Medium Risk (10-30s timeout)**:
- `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`
- `markdownlint` on multiple files
- File operations on large files

**Low Risk (5-10s timeout)**:
- `echo`, `pwd`, `ls`, `cat`
- Simple git operations
- Basic file reads

#### 2.3 Safe Command Patterns
```markdown
# Instead of:
Bash(npm install)

# Use:
Bash(npm install, timeout=120000, description="Install dependencies with 2min timeout")

# For potentially hanging commands:
Bash(cspell "**/*.md", timeout=30000, description="Spell check with 30s timeout protection")
```

## Phase 3: Universal Timeout Protection Implementation

### Implementation Strategy
Add systematic timeout protection to all external tool operations across the agent ecosystem.

### Components

#### 3.1 Timeout Defaults by Tool Type
```markdown
# Standard Timeout Values
- cspell operations: 30000ms (30s)
- npm/npx operations: 120000ms (2min)  
- git operations: 60000ms (1min)
- gh API operations: 45000ms (45s)
- file operations: 15000ms (15s)
- general commands: 10000ms (10s)
```

#### 3.2 Agent Timeout Implementation Pattern
All agents must include timeout parameters in Bash calls:
```markdown
# Required format for external tools
Bash(command="command_here", timeout=30000, description="Clear description")

# Error handling for timeouts
If timeout occurs:
1. Log timeout event to agent-activity.log
2. Report timeout error with full context
3. Delegate to claude-problem-solver for permanent solution
4. Continue with alternative approaches if possible
```

#### 3.3 Timeout Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue operation with reduced functionality when possible
- **Error Reporting**: All timeouts logged and reported to problem tracking
- **Alternative Strategies**: Fallback approaches for essential operations
- **User Notification**: Clear communication when timeouts affect functionality

## Phase 4: Circuit Breaker Implementation

### Implementation Strategy
Implement real-time detection of problematic delegation patterns with automatic protection mechanisms.

### Components

#### 4.1 Delegation Pattern Monitoring
```markdown
# Circuit Breaker Logic (add to all agents)
Before any Task() delegation:
1. Read last 20 lines of D:\agent-activity.log
2. Count current agent appearances in last 60 seconds
3. If count > 3: Use work_type="queue_addition" instead of real-time delegation
4. Log circuit breaker activation
```

#### 4.2 Circuit Breaker Thresholds
- **Agent Instance Limit**: Same agent called >3 times in 60 seconds
- **Depth Escalation Protection**: Rapid depth increases (0->2->3 in <30s)
- **Command Repetition**: Same external command repeated >5 times in 2 minutes
- **Global Activity**: >10 total delegations across all agents in 30 seconds

#### 4.3 Circuit Breaker Actions
**Triggered Actions**:
1. **Log Event**: Record circuit breaker activation with full context
2. **Switch to Queue**: Use `work_type="queue_addition"` for subsequent delegations
3. **Notify User**: Send notification about protection activation
4. **Cool-down Period**: 120-second minimum before circuit reset

## Phase 5: Agent-Specific Safety Enhancements

### Implementation Strategy
Update each agent with specific safety measures based on their external tool usage patterns.

### Components

#### 5.1 High-Risk Agent Updates
**spell-checking-coordinator**:
- All cspell operations must have 30s timeout
- Dictionary operations limited to 5 words per batch
- Circuit breaker for repeated spell check failures

**mcp-manager**:
- NPX operations require 60s timeout
- Server installation verification with functional testing
- Rollback mechanisms for failed installations

**planning-coordinator**:
- GH operations require 45s timeout
- GitHub API rate limiting protection
- Batch operations for multiple project updates

#### 5.2 Medium-Risk Agent Updates
**claude-config-manager**:
- File operations require 15s timeout
- Configuration validation after changes
- Backup and rollback for configuration failures

**documentation-specialist**:
- Markdownlint operations require 30s timeout
- File processing in batches for large documentation sets
- Skip problematic files rather than hanging

#### 5.3 Safety Pattern Templates
```markdown
# Standard Safety Template for All Agents
## External Command Safety Protocol
1. **Timeout Protection**: All external commands MUST include timeout parameter
2. **Error Logging**: Log all command failures to agent-activity.log
3. **Circuit Breaker Check**: Verify delegation patterns before Task() calls
4. **Graceful Failure**: Continue with reduced functionality when commands fail
5. **Problem Reporting**: Delegate persistent failures to claude-problem-solver
```

## Phase 6: Testing and Validation Framework

### Implementation Strategy
Establish comprehensive testing protocols to validate crash prevention measures work under complex scenarios.

### Components

#### 6.1 Crash Simulation Testing
- **Agent Loop Simulation**: Intentionally create delegation patterns that would cause loops
- **External Tool Blocking**: Test timeout protection with deliberately slow commands
- **Complex Scenario Testing**: Multi-agent workflows similar to "Storacle Feature review"
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Test behavior under high delegation activity

#### 6.2 Monitoring and Alerting
- **Real-time Log Monitoring**: Track agent-activity.log for problematic patterns
- **Timeout Rate Tracking**: Monitor frequency of timeout events
- **Circuit Breaker Analytics**: Track activation patterns and effectiveness
- **Performance Impact**: Measure logging and safety overhead

#### 6.3 Continuous Improvement
- **Pattern Analysis**: Regular review of agent-activity.log for improvement opportunities
- **Timeout Optimization**: Adjust timeout values based on actual performance data
- **Safety Enhancement**: Iterative improvement of circuit breaker logic
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep safety protocols current with new findings

- **Complete Visibility**: Full logging of all agent delegations and external commands
- **Automatic Protection**: Circuit breakers prevent problematic patterns without user intervention
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues functioning even when individual commands fail

### Performance Metrics
- **Timeout Event Rate**: <5% of external commands should hit timeouts
- **Circuit Breaker Activation**: <1 activation per hour during normal operation
- **Log File Growth**: agent-activity.log should not exceed 1MB per day
- **User Impact**: Safety measures should not noticeably impact user experience

### Quality Assurance
- **Agent Compliance**: 100% of agents must implement timeout protection
- **Error Handling**: All timeout and circuit breaker events must be properly logged
- **Problem Resolution**: Issues identified through logging must be escalated appropriately
- **Documentation**: All safety measures must be documented and maintained

## Risk Mitigation

### Implementation Risks
- **Performance Impact**: Logging and checking overhead may slow operations
- **False Positives**: Circuit breakers may trigger unnecessarily, reducing functionality
- **Maintenance Burden**: Extensive logging and monitoring requires ongoing maintenance

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Selective Logging**: Focus on high-value events, avoid excessive detail
- **Threshold Tuning**: Carefully calibrate circuit breaker thresholds to minimize false positives
- **Automated Maintenance**: Build log rotation and cleanup into the system
- **Gradual Rollout**: Implement safety measures incrementally to identify issues early

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive approach to preventing Claude Code crashes while maintaining system functionality and providing tools for ongoing monitoring and improvement.
