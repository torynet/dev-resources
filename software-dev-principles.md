# Software Development Principles

## Core Development Philosophy

### Code Quality and Maintainability

- Write code that expresses intent clearly - favor readability over cleverness
- Use descriptive variable and function names that eliminate the need for comments
- Keep functions and classes focused on single responsibilities
- Prefer composition over inheritance for flexibility
- Write tests that document expected behavior and prevent regressions

### Code Formatting and Quality Tools

- **Use code formatting tools** (e.g., Prettier) to maintain consistent code style automatically
- **Apply language-specific linting tools** (e.g., ESLint, Pylint, PMD) to catch errors and enforce standards
- **Use spelling checkers** (e.g., cspell) to catch typos in code, comments, and documentation
- **Maintain project dictionaries** for technical terms and domain-specific vocabulary
- **Configure tools to run automatically** on save or as pre-commit hooks
- **Avoid unnecessary blank lines and trailing spaces** - keep code clean and compact

### Programming Paradigm Preferences

- **Prefer functional over object-oriented patterns** when both approaches are viable
- Use pure functions without side effects when possible
- Favor immutable data structures and values
- Use functional composition over class inheritance
- Apply object-oriented principles primarily for complex state management and system boundaries

### SOLID Principles

Follow the SOLID principles for object-oriented design:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class should have only one reason to change
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without breaking functionality
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Error Handling and Resilience

- Fail fast and fail clearly with descriptive error messages
- Handle errors at the appropriate abstraction level
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Design for graceful degradation when possible
- Validate inputs early and provide clear feedback

### Performance and Scalability

- Profile before optimizing - measure actual performance bottlenecks
- Design for the expected scale, not theoretical maximum scale
- Cache strategically with clear expiration and invalidation policies
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms for the use case
- Consider memory usage and garbage collection impact

## Project Structure and Organization

### File and Directory Organization

- Group related functionality into cohesive modules or packages
- Use consistent naming conventions across the entire project
- Separate concerns: configuration, business logic, data access, presentation
- Keep project root clean - use subdirectories for different types of files
- Document project structure in README with clear navigation

### Dependency Management

- Minimize dependencies - each dependency is a liability
- Pin versions to ensure reproducible builds
- Regularly audit and update dependencies for security
- Use virtual environments or containers for isolation
- Document all required system dependencies

### Configuration Management

- Externalize all environment-specific configuration
- Use configuration files or environment variables, never hardcode
- Provide sensible defaults for local development
- Validate configuration at startup with clear error messages
- Document all configuration options with examples

## Development Process

### Version Control Best Practices

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages that explain why, not what
- Make atomic commits - one logical change per commit
- Use branching strategy appropriate to team size and release cycle
- Review all code changes before merging to main branch
- Tag releases with semantic versioning

### Testing Strategy

- Write tests for all business logic and critical paths
- Use unit tests for individual components, integration tests for workflows
- Test error conditions and edge cases, not just happy paths
- Keep tests simple, fast, and independent of each other
- Run tests automatically on every commit

### Documentation

- Document the why, not the what - code should be self-documenting
- Keep documentation close to the code it describes
- Include examples and common use cases in documentation
- Update documentation as part of code changes, not as an afterthought
- Write README files that help new developers get started quickly

## Security and Privacy

### Secure Development

- Never commit secrets or credentials to version control
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow principle of least privilege for system access

### Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper session management and timeout policies
- Log security-relevant events for audit purposes
- Handle personal data according to applicable privacy regulations
- Design systems to minimize data collection and retention

## Collaboration and Communication

### Code Review Process

- Review for logic, security, performance, and maintainability
- Provide constructive feedback focused on the code, not the person
- Ask questions when you don't understand something
- Suggest improvements rather than just pointing out problems
- Accept feedback gracefully and iterate quickly

### Team Communication

- Communicate early about design decisions and potential issues
- Document decisions and their rationale for future reference
- Share knowledge through code reviews, pair programming, or documentation
- Be responsive to questions and requests for help
- Escalate blockers quickly rather than struggling alone

## Deployment and Operations

### Release Management

- Automate build, test, and deployment processes
- Use feature flags to decouple deployment from release
- Plan rollback procedures before deploying to production
- Monitor applications after deployment to catch issues early
- Maintain deployment logs and audit trails

### Monitoring and Observability

- Implement proper logging with structured, searchable formats
- Monitor key business and technical metrics
- Set up alerts for critical failures and performance degradation
- Use distributed tracing for complex systems
- Plan for capacity monitoring and scaling decisions
